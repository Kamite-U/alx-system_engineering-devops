Life is so beautiful when you have the right people beside you.
Never let anyone make you believe you are not worthy of love.
I wish someone told me that when I was in high school...
Maybe it would have saved me so much time from crying every night.
Live as if you were to die tomorrow.
Live without ever forgetting that God loves you, no matter what people may do or tell you.
